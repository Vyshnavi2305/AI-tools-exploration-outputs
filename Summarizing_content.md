Here’s a concise summary of your PDF (OS R23 Unit 4):



Memory Management Strategies

Purpose: Efficiently manage system memory, support multiple processes, protect processes from each other, and maximize resource utilization.

Contiguous Allocation: Processes are stored in continuous memory blocks, causing issues like fragmentation.

Paging: Divides memory into fixed-size blocks (pages/frames), enabling non-contiguous storage and reducing fragmentation.

Segmentation: Memory is divided based on logical segments (functions, arrays), matching user/programmer view.

Address Binding and Logical vs. Physical Address

Binding: Assigning program/data addresses to memory at compile-time, load-time, or run-time.

Logical vs. Physical Address: Logical (virtual) addresses are generated by the CPU; physical addresses refer to actual memory locations.



Swapping

Temporarily moves processes between main memory and disk; supports multitasking and priority scheduling.



Memory Management Unit (MMU)

Hardware that maps virtual addresses to physical addresses using tables and registers (e.g., base and limit registers).



Dynamic Loading and Linking

Dynamic Loading: Loads program parts into memory as needed.

Dynamic Linking: Links libraries when routines are called, not during program load.



Paging Structures

Page Tables: Used to map virtual to physical addresses; can be hierarchical, hashed, or inverted for efficiency.

TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer): Cache to speed up address translation.



Memory Protection and Sharing

Achieved through valid-invalid bits and protection bits in page tables.

Supports shared/common code and private data.



Virtual Memory

Allows processes to use more memory than physically available using techniques like paging or segmentation.

Demand Paging: Loads pages into memory only when needed, reducing memory consumption and speeding up process starts.



Page Replacement Algorithms

Replace pages in memory when needed:

FIFO: First-in, first-out.

Optimal: Replace the page not needed for the longest time.

LRU: Least recently used.

LFU/MFU: Least/Most frequently used.

Second Chance, Clock, and related enhancements.



Thrashing

System spends excessive time swapping pages instead of doing useful work, due to too many active processes and insufficient frames.



HDD Storage and Scheduling

Reasons for Disk Scheduling: Improve speed due to slow physical disk access.

Algorithms:

FCFS: First-come, first-served.

SSTF: Shortest seek time first.

SCAN/LOOK/CSCAN/CLOOK: Move disk arm in ordered ways to reduce wait/seek time.



Copy-on-Write (COW)

An optimization where processes share memory pages until modification—then a private copy is created for the writing process.

Advantages: Reduces memory use; speeds up process creation.

Drawbacks: Overhead in copying on write, increased memory if modifications are frequent.



Storage Hierarchy

Systems use multiple storage types (registers, cache, RAM, disks, tapes) with a trade-off between speed, cost, and volatility.



Key Takeaways:

This chapter covers how operating systems manage memory (both main and secondary), techniques for allocation and protection, virtual memory concepts, page
replacement, storage/disk management algorithms, and optimizations like Copy-on-Write to balance efficiency, fairness, and system performance.
