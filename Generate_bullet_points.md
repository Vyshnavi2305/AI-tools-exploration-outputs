Definition: Demand paging is a process of swapping in the Virtual Memory system.

In this process, all data is not moved from hard drive to main memory because while

using this demand paging, when some programs are getting demand then data will be

transferred. But, if required data is already existed into memory then not need to copy

of data. The demand paging system is done with swapping from auxiliary

storage to primary memory, so it is known as “Lazy

Evaluation”. convert this paragraph into bullet points



Demand paging is a process of swapping in the virtual memory system.

Not all data is moved from the hard drive to main memory at once.

Data (pages) are transferred to main memory only when they are requested by a program.

If the required data is already in memory, it is not copied again.

Demand paging involves swapping data from auxiliary storage to primary memory only as needed.

This technique is called "Lazy Evaluation" because pages are loaded only when demanded.
